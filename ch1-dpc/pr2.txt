	Power Control Infeasibility
*************************************************

When does a set of target SIRs with fixed channel
conditions (Gain Matrix, Noise) are not possible to 
achieve ?

Graph: In pr2.png it can be observed that 
the transmitted powers are continously increasing and
not converging. The transmitters end up in a non-ending 
competition to reach their target SNRs and eventually reach 
a state where it is not feasible increase any power.
