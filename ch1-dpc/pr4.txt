In the following game payoffs of Alice and Bob are - 

		Alice - a	Alice - b
Bob - a  	(0, 2)		(2, 0)
Bob - b		(6, 0)		(3, 2)

1) Is there a Nash equilibrium ? What is it ?

Ans:
	If Alice chooses a; Bob gets 2 by playing a (> 0)
		(a, a)
	If Alice chooses b; Bob gets 2 by playing b (> 0)
		(b, b)

	If Bob chooses a; Alice gets 2 by playing b (> 0)
		(b, a)
	If Bob chooses b; Alice gets 6 by playing a (> 3)
		(a, b)
	
	So a Nash Equilibrium doesn't exist in this game.

2) Change the entries in such a way that resulting Nash equilibrium
   is unique and socially optimal.

   Lets try making (a, b) a unique nash equilibrium. So a should be 
   best response strategy for Alice and b should be best response strategy
   for Bob.
 
	If Alice chooses a; Bob should get > 2 to make him 
	play b. Lets make the payoff 3
	
	If Alice chooses b; Bob already gets 2 by playing b

	If Bob chooses a; Alice should get > 2 (< 6) to make her 
	play a. Lets make the payoff 3

	If Bob chooses b; Alice gets 6 by playing a (> 3).

	So the table becomes - 

                Alice - a       Alice - b
Bob - a         (3, 2)          (2, 0)
Bob - b         (6, 3)          (3, 2)

	Let's check if it is unique - 
		Alice a; Bob b (3 > 2) - (a, b)
		Alice b; Bob b (2 > 0) - (b, b)

		Bob a; Alice a (3 > 2) - (a, a)
		Bob b; Alice a (6 > 3) - (a, b)

	This equilibrium is also socially optimal (6 + 3)
