	Repeating Prisonner's Dilemma	
*************************************************

a) Suppose the two prisonner's know that they will 
somehow be caught in the same situation five more times 
in future years. What will each prisoner's strategy
be in choosing between confession and no confession ?

By Backward Induction. 

Round 5 - This is a normal prisoner's dilemma, both players
are trying to maximize their payoffs. And hence their best response
strategy is going to be confess

	Round - 1 2 3 4 5
			C

Round 4 - They knew that they are going to confess in the 5th
round, so co-operative contingent strategy doesn't work
anymore. Both players will try to maximize their payoffs as
in normal prisoner's dilemma.

	Round - 1 2 3 4 5
		      C C

This way we can prove that the players are going to confess in 
all other rounds.

	Round - 1 2 3 4 5
		C C C C C

b) Suppose the two prisoners have infinite lifetimes,
and there is always a 90% chance that they will be 
caught in the same situation after each round of this
game. What will each prisoner's strategy be now ?

Since there are high chances (90 %) that the prisoners 
are going to end up in the same situation it is possible that
they will see the game in a different light. Intutively, long term 
relationships are fundamentally different from one-shot meetings.
Instead of maximising their individual payoffs by confessing they
may adopt to co-operative contingent strategy ( don't confess 
unless the other one confesses ) along the way. 
Hence in case of infinitel repeated with 90 % chance the equilibrium 
is (No Confess, No Confess)
