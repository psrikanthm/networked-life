#	Spectrum Auction and package bidding			#
#################################################################

a) Since it is simultaneous ascending auction, each seat is valued 
   independently. Bidder 1 guesses that Bidder 2 values the seat for 
	$10. So Bidder 1 has to bid each seat for > $10 which will 
	result in negative payoff > $5.
	If Bidder 1 does truthful bidding, she won't get the seat.
	And Bidder 2 can get the seat at truthful bidding $10

   By not allowing package bidding, one of the seat is left unused.
   And the potential revenue to organiser reduced by $5

b) In package bidding, If Bidder 1 guesses  the combined value at $12
	she will make the bid for two seats at > $12 say, $13

	Payoffs:
		Bidder 1 - $15 - $13 = $2
		Bidder 2 - 0
